function Get-PSVersion {
    # .SYNOPSIS
    # Returns the version of PowerShell that is running.
    #
    # .DESCRIPTION
    # The function outputs a [version] object representing the version of
    # PowerShell that is running.
    #
    # On versions of PowerShell greater than or equal to version 2.0, this
    # function returns the equivalent of $PSVersionTable.PSVersion
    #
    # PowerShell 1.0 does not have a $PSVersionTable variable, so this function
    # returns [version]('1.0') on PowerShell 1.0.
    #
    # .EXAMPLE
    # $versionPS = Get-PSVersion
    # # $versionPS now contains the version of PowerShell that is running. On
    # # versions of PowerShell greater than or equal to version 2.0, this
    # # function returns the equivalent of $PSVersionTable.PSVersion
    #
    # .INPUTS
    # None. You can't pipe objects to Get-PSVersion.
    #
    # .OUTPUTS
    # System.Version. Get-PSVersion returns a [version] value indiciating
    # the version of PowerShell that is running.
