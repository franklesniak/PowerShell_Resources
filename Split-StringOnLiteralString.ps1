function Split-StringOnLiteralString {
    # Split-StringOnLiteralString is designed to split a string the way the way that I
    # expected it to be done - using a literal string (as opposed to regex). It's also
    # designed to be backward-compatible with all versions of PowerShell and has been
    # tested successfully on PowerShell v1. My motivation for creating this function
    # was 1) I wanted a split function that behaved more like VBScript's Split
    # function, 2) I did not want to be messing around with RegEx, and 3) I needed code
    # that was backward-compatible with all versions of PowerShell.
    #
    # This function takes two positional arguments
    # The first argument is a string, and the string to be split
    # The second argument is a string or char, and it is that which is to split the string in the first parameter
    #
    # Note: This function always returns an array, even when there is zero or one element in it.
    #
    # Example:
    # $result = Split-StringOnLiteralString 'foo' ' '
    # # $result.GetType().FullName is System.Object[]
    # # $result.Count is 1
    #
    # Example 2:
    # $result = Split-StringOnLiteralString 'What do you think of this function?' ' '
    # # $result.Count is 7
