function Test-Windows {
    #region FunctionHeader #################################################
    # Returns a boolean ($true or $false) indicating whether the current
    # PowerShell session is running on Windows. This function is useful for
    # writing scripts that need to behave differently on Windows and non-
    # Windows platforms (Linux, macOS, etc.). Additionally, this function is
    # useful because it works on Windows PowerShell 1.0 through 5.1, which do
    # not have the $IsWindows global variable.
    #
    # Example:
    # $boolIsWindows = Test-Windows
    #
    # This example returns $true if the current PowerShell session is running
    # on Windows, and $false if the current PowerShell session is running on a
    # non-Windows platform (Linux, macOS, etc.)

    function Get-PSVersion {
        # .SYNOPSIS
        # Returns the version of PowerShell that is running.
        #
        # .DESCRIPTION
        # The function outputs a [version] object representing the version of
        # PowerShell that is running.
        #
        # On versions of PowerShell greater than or equal to version 2.0, this
        # function returns the equivalent of $PSVersionTable.PSVersion
        #
        # PowerShell 1.0 does not have a $PSVersionTable variable, so this function
        # returns [version]('1.0') on PowerShell 1.0.
        #
        # .EXAMPLE
        # $versionPS = Get-PSVersion
        # # $versionPS now contains the version of PowerShell that is running. On
        # # versions of PowerShell greater than or equal to version 2.0, this
        # # function returns the equivalent of $PSVersionTable.PSVersion
        #
        # .INPUTS
        # None. You can't pipe objects to Get-PSVersion.
        #
        # .OUTPUTS
        # System.Version. Get-PSVersion returns a [version] value indiciating
        # the version of PowerShell that is running.
        #
