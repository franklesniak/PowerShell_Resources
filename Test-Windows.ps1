function Get-PSVersion {
    # Returns the version of PowerShell that is running, including on the original
    # release of Windows PowerShell (version 1.0)
    #
    # Example:
    # Get-PSVersion
    #
    # This example returns the version of PowerShell that is running. On versions
    # of PowerShell greater than or equal to version 2.0, this function returns the
    # equivalent of $PSVersionTable.PSVersion
    #
    # The function outputs a [version] object representing the version of
    # PowerShell that is running
    #
    # PowerShell 1.0 does not have a $PSVersionTable variable, so this function
    # returns [version]('1.0') on PowerShell 1.0

    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Returns a boolean ($true or $false) indicating whether the current PowerShell
    session is running on Windows

    .DESCRIPTION
    Returns a boolean ($true or $false) indicating whether the current PowerShell
    session is running on Windows. This function is useful for writing scripts that
    need to behave differently on Windows and non-Windows platforms (Linux, macOS,
    etc.). Additionally, this function is useful because it works on Windows PowerShell
    1.0 through 5.1, which do not have the $IsWindows global variable.

    .EXAMPLE
    Test-Windows

    This example returns $true if the current PowerShell session is running on Windows,
    and $false if the current PowerShell session is running on a non-Windows platform
    (Linux, macOS, etc.)

    .OUTPUTS
    A [Boolean] object representing whether the current platform is Windows ($true) or
    non-Windows ($false)

    .NOTES
    PowerShell 1.0 through 5.1 do not have a built-in $IsWindows global variable,
    making the test for whether the current platform is Windows a bit more complicated
