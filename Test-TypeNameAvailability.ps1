function Test-TypeNameAvailability {
    # .SYNOPSIS
    # Tests to see if a type is available.
    #
    # .DESCRIPTION
    # Determines if a type name is available for use. Returns $true if the type
    # name is available in the current context; returns $false if it is not
    # available.
    #
    # .PARAMETER TypeName
    # This parameter is required; it is a string that contains the name of the
    # type for which the function will determine availability.
    #
    # .EXAMPLE
    # $boolTypeAvailable = Test-TypeNameAvailability -TypeName 'Microsoft.Exchange.Data.RecipientAccessRight'
    #
    # .EXAMPLE
    # $boolTypeAvailable = Test-TypeNameAvailability 'Microsoft.Exchange.Data.RecipientAccessRight'
    #
    # .INPUTS
    # None. You can't pipe objects to Test-TypeNameAvailability.
    #
    # .OUTPUTS
    # System.Boolean. Test-TypeNameAvailability returns a boolean value
    # indicating whether the type is available in the current context. The
    # function returns $true if the type name is available in the current
    # context; $false otherwise.
    #
    # .NOTES
    # This function also supports the use of a positional parameter instead of
    # a named parameter. If a positional parameter is used instead of a named
    # parameter, then exactly one positional parameters is required: it is a
    # string that contains the name of the type for which the function will
    # determine availability.
