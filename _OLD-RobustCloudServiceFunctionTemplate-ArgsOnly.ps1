        # Using two references (memory pointers) to errors, this function
        # checks to see if an error occurred based on differences between

        # To use this function, you must first retrieve a reference to the

        # run. Then, run the command. After the command completes, retrieve
        # a reference to the last error that occurred. Pass these two

        # the command for which you wish to determine whether an error
        # occurred.
        #
        # If no error was on the stack at this time,
        # ReferenceToEarlierError must be a reference to $null

        # This parameter is required; it is a reference (memory pointer) to

        # newest error on the stack later in time, i.e., after to running
        # the command for which you wish to determine whether an error
