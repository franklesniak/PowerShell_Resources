function Join-PathSafely {
    #region FunctionHeader #####################################################
    # Combines two paths into a single path. This function is intended to be
    # used in situations where the Join-Path cmdlet may fail due to a variety
    # of reasons. This function is designed to suppress errors and return a
    # boolean value indicating whether the operation was successful.
    #
    # Three positional arguments are required:
    #
    # The first argument is a reference to a string variable that will be populated
    # with the joined path (parent path + child path). If the# operation was
    # successful, the variable will be populated with the joined path. If the
    # operation was unsuccessful, the variable will be left unchanged.
    #
    # The second argument is a string representing the parent part of the path.
    #
    # The third argument is the child part of the path.
    #
    # The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation was
    # successful. If the operation was successful, the joined path will be
    # populated in the variable referenced in the first argument. If the operation
    # was unsuccessful, the variable will be left unchanged.
    #
    # Example usage:
    # $strParentPartOfPath = 'Z:'
    # $strChildPartOfPath = '####FAKE####'
    # $strJoinedPath = $null
    # $boolSuccess = Join-PathSafely ([ref]$strJoinedPath) $strParentPartOfPath $strChildPartOfPath
