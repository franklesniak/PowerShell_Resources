function Get-AclSafely {
    #region FunctionHeader #####################################################
    # Gets and returns the access control list (ACL) from a path or object. This
    # function is intended to be used in situations where the Get-Acl cmdlet may
    # fail due to a variety of reasons. This function is designed to suppress
    # errors and return a boolean value indicating whether the operation was
    # successful.
    #
    # Three positional arguments are required:
    #
    # The first argument is a reference to an object (the specific object type will
    # vary depending on the type of object/path supplied in the third argument). If
    # the operation was successful, the referenced object will be populated with
    # the object resulting from Get-Acl. If the operation was unsuccessful, the
    # referenced object will be left unchanged.
    #
    # The second argument is a reference to an object (the specific object type
    # will vary depending on the type of object/path supplied in the third
    # argument). In cases where this function needs to retrieve the object (using
    # Get-Item) to retrieve the access control entry (ACL), the referenced object
    # will be populated with the object resulting from Get-Item. If the function
    # did not need to use Get-Item, the referenced object will be left unchanged.
    #
    # The third argument is a string representing the path to the object for which
    # the ACL is to be retrieved. This path can be a file or folder path, or it can
    # be a registry path (for example).
    #
    # The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation was
    # successful. If the operation was successful, the object referenced in the
    # first argument will be populated with the ACL (otherwise the object
    # referenced in the first argument is not changed). If the function needed to
    # retrieve the object (using Get-Item) to get its access control list (ACL),
    # the object referenced in the second argument will be populated with the
    # object (from Get-Item), otherwise the object referenced in the second
    # argument is not changed.
    #
    # Example usage:
    # $objThisFolderPermission = $null
    # $objThis = $null
    # $strThisObjectPath = 'D:\Shares\Share\Accounting'
    # $boolSuccess = Get-AclSafely ([ref]$objThisFolderPermission) ([ref]$objThis) $strThisObjectPath
