function Convert-StringToInt32Safely {
    # .SYNOPSIS
    # Attempts to convert a string to a System.Int32.
    #
    # .DESCRIPTION
    # Attempts to convert a string to a System.Int32. If the string
    # cannot be converted to a System.Int32, the function suppresses the
    # error and returns $false. If the string can be converted to an
    # int32, the function returns $true and passes the int32 by
    # reference to the caller.
    #
    # .PARAMETER ReferenceToInt32
    # This parameter is required; it is a reference to a System.Int32
    # object that will be used to store the converted int32 object if the
    # conversion is successful.
    #
    # .PARAMETER StringToConvert
    # This parameter is required; it is a string that is to be converted to
    # a System.Int32 object.
    #
    # .EXAMPLE
    # $int = $null
    # $strInt = '1234'
    # $boolSuccess = Convert-StringToInt32Safely -ReferenceToInt32 ([ref]$int) -StringToConvert $strInt
    # # $boolSuccess will be $true, indicating that the conversion was
    # # successful.
    # # $int will contain a System.Int32 object equal to 1234.
    #
    # .EXAMPLE
    # $int = $null
    # $strInt = 'abc'
    # $boolSuccess = Convert-StringToInt32Safely -ReferenceToInt32 ([ref]$int) -StringToConvert $strInt
    # # $boolSuccess will be $false, indicating that the conversion was
    # # unsuccessful.
    # # $int will be undefined in this case.
    #
    # .INPUTS
    # None. You can't pipe objects to Convert-StringToInt32Safely.
    #
    # .OUTPUTS
    # System.Boolean. Convert-StringToInt32Safely returns a boolean value
    # indiciating whether the process completed successfully. $true means
    # the conversion completed successfully; $false means there was an
    # error.
    #
    # .NOTES
    # This function also supports the use of positional parameters instead
    # of named parameters. If positional parameters are used instead of
    # named parameters, then two positional parameters are required:
    #
    # The first positional parameter is a reference to a System.Int32
    # object that will be used to store the converted int32 object if the
    # conversion is successful.
    #
    # The second positional parameter is a string that is to be converted to
    # a System.Int32 object.
