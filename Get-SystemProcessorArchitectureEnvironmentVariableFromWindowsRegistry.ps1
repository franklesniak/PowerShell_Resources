    function Get-ReferenceToLastError {
        # .SYNOPSIS
        # Gets a reference (memory pointer) to the last error that occurred.
        #
        # .DESCRIPTION
        # Returns $null if no errors on on the $error stack; otherwise, returns
        # a reference (memory pointer) to the last error that occurred.
        #
        # .EXAMPLE
        # # Intentionally empty trap statement to prevent terminating errors
        # # from halting processing
        # trap { }
        #
        # # Retrieve the newest error on the stack prior to doing work:
        # $refLastKnownError = Get-ReferenceToLastError
        #
        # # Store current error preference; we will restore it after we do some
        # # work:
        # $actionPreferenceFormerErrorPreference = $global:ErrorActionPreference
        #
        # # Set ErrorActionPreference to SilentlyContinue; this will suppress
        # # error output. Terminating errors will not output anything, kick to
        # # the empty trap statement and then continue on. Likewise, non-
        # # terminating errors will also not output anything, but they do not
        # # kick to the trap statement; they simply continue on.
        # $global:ErrorActionPreference = [System.Management.Automation.ActionPreference]::SilentlyContinue
        #
        # # Do something that might trigger an error
        # Get-Item -Path 'C:\MayNotExist.txt'
        #
        # # Restore the former error preference
        # $global:ErrorActionPreference = $actionPreferenceFormerErrorPreference
        #
        # # Retrieve the newest error on the error stack

        # } else {
        #     # One is $null, or both are $null

        #     # $refNewestCurrentError could be null if $error was cleared;
        #     # this does not indicate an error.
        #     # So:
        #     # If both are null, no error
        #     # If $refLastKnownError is null and $refNewestCurrentError is
        #     # non-null, error
        #     # If $refLastKnownError is non-null and $refNewestCurrentError is
        #     # null, no error
        #     if (($null -eq $refLastKnownError) -and ($null -ne $refNewestCurrentError)) {
        #         $boolErrorOccurred = $true
        #     }
        # }

        #
        # .OUTPUTS
