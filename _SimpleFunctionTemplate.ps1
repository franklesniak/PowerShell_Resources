function Invoke-SimpleFunction {
    # .SYNOPSIS
    # Very brief description of the function here. Limit the character width to
    # 88 characters if the function will not be nested within another function,
    # 84 characters if it will be nested once, 80 characters if it will be
    # nested twice, etc.
    #
    # .DESCRIPTION
    # Longer-form description of the function here.
    #
    # .PARAMETER Parameter1
    # This parameter is required; it is a reference to a <object type> that
    # will be used to store output.
    #
    # .PARAMETER Parameter2
    # This parameter is required; it is a string representing ...
    #
    # .PARAMETER Parameter3
    # This parameter is optional; if supplied, it is an array of characters
    # that represent ...
    #
    # .PARAMETER Parameter4
    # This parameter is optional; if supplied, it is a boolean value that
    # indicates whether ...
    #
    # .PARAMETER Parameter5
    # This parameter is optional; if supplied, it is a boolean value that
    # indicates whether ...
    #
    # .PARAMETER Parameter6
    # This parameter is optional; if supplied, it is a string representation
    # of ...
    #
    # .PARAMETER Parameter7
    # This parameter is optional; if supplied, it is a boolean value that
    # indicates whether ...
    #
    # .PARAMETER Parameter8
    # This parameter is optional; if supplied, it is a string representation of
    # ...
    #
    # .EXAMPLE
    # $hashtableConfigIni = $null
    # $intReturnCode = Invoke-SimpleFunction -Parameter1 ([ref]$hashtableConfigIni) -Parameter2 '.\config.ini' -Parameter3 @(';') -Parameter4 $true -Parameter5 $true -Parameter6 'NoSection' -Parameter7 $true
    #
    # .EXAMPLE
    # $hashtableConfigIni = $null
    # $intReturnCode = Invoke-SimpleFunction ([ref]$hashtableConfigIni) '.\config.ini' @(';') $true $true 'NoSection' $true
    #
    # .INPUTS
    # None. You can't pipe objects to Invoke-SimpleFunction.
    #
    # .OUTPUTS
    # System.Boolean. Invoke-SimpleFunction returns a boolean value indiciating
    # whether the process completed successfully. $true means the process
    # completed successfully; $false means there was an error.
    #

    ################### IF PARAMETERS ARE BEING USED FOR THIS FUNCTION, THEN THIS BLURB SHOULD BE INCLUDED. HOWEVER, BE MINDFUL THAT [SWITCH] PARAMETERS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN POSITIONAL PARAMETERS BY DEFAULT ###################
    # This function also supports the use of positional parameters instead of named
    # parameters. If positional parameters are used instead of named parameters,
    # then X positional parameters are required:
