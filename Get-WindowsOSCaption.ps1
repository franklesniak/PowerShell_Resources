function Get-WindowsOSCaption {
    # .SYNOPSIS
    # Gets the Windows operating system caption (name) from WMI
    #
    # .DESCRIPTION
    # This function retrieves the Windows operating system caption (name)
    # from WMI and returns it as a string. If the caption was determined
    # successfully, the function returns $true; otherwise, it returns $false.
    #
    # .PARAMETER ReferenceToOSCaption
    # This parameter is required; it is a reference to a string that will be
    # used to store the Windows operating system caption (name).
    #
    # .PARAMETER PSVersion
    # This parameter is optional; if supplied, it must be the version number of the
    # running version of PowerShell. If the version of PowerShell is already known,
    # it can be passed in to this function to avoid the overhead of unnecessarily
    # determining the version of PowerShell. If this parameter is not supplied, the
    # function will determine the version of PowerShell that is running as part of
    # its processing.
    #
    # .EXAMPLE
    # $versionPS = $PSVersionTable.PSVersion
    # $strOSCaption = ''
    # $intReturnCode = Get-WindowsOSCaption -ReferenceToOSCaption ([ref]$strOSCaption) -PSVersion $versionPS
    #
    # .EXAMPLE
    # $strOSCaption = ''
    # $intReturnCode = Get-WindowsOSCaption -ReferenceToOSCaption ([ref]$strOSCaption)
    #
    # .INPUTS
    # None. You can't pipe objects to Get-WindowsOSCaption.
    #
    # .OUTPUTS
    # System.Int32. Get-WindowsOSCaption returns an integer value indicating
    # whether the process completed successfully. 0 means the process completed
    # successfully, a negative value indicates that an error occurred, and a
    # positive value indicates that the process completed but there was one or more
    # warnings.
