function Get-ExportedTypesFromRuntimeAssemblySafely {
    # .SYNOPSIS
    # Obtains the exported types from a RuntimeAssembly object.
    #
    # .DESCRIPTION
    # Given a RuntimeAssembly object, this function retrieves the exported
    # types from the assembly, but does so in a way that suppresses errors from
    # being displayed to the console. This function is useful when you want to
    # obtain the exported types from an assembly, but you don't want to see any
    # errors that may occur during the process. The function returns $true if
    # no errors occurred; otherwise, it returns $false.
    #
    # .PARAMETER ReferenceToArrayOfExportedTypes
    # This parameter is required; it is a reference to a System.Object[]
    # (array) that will be used to store output. If the export of types is
    # successful, the function guarantees that the referenced object will
    # always be an array, even when a single item is returned. If the export of
    # types is unsuccessful, the referenced object is undefined.
    #
    # .PARAMETER ReferenceToSystemReflectionRuntimeAssembly
    # This parameter is a reference (pointer) to a
    # System.Reflection.RuntimeAssembly object from which the function will get
    # its exported types.
    #
    # .EXAMPLE
    # $arrReturnData = @()
    # $arrAssemblies = @([AppDomain]::CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies())
    # $boolSuccess = Get-ExportedTypesFromRuntimeAssemblySafely -ReferenceToArrayOfExportedTypes ([ref]$arrReturnData) -ReferenceToSystemReflectionRuntimeAssembly ([ref]($arrAssemblies[0]))
    #
    # .EXAMPLE
    # $arrReturnData = @()
    # $arrAssemblies = @([AppDomain]::CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies())
    # $boolSuccess = Get-ExportedTypesFromRuntimeAssemblySafely ([ref]$arrReturnData) ([ref]($arrAssemblies[0]))
    #
    # .INPUTS
    # None. You can't pipe objects to
    # Get-ExportedTypesFromRuntimeAssemblySafely.
    #
    # .OUTPUTS
    # System.Boolean. Get-ExportedTypesFromRuntimeAssemblySafely returns a
    # boolean value indiciating whether the process completed successfully.
    # $true means the process completed successfully; $false means there was an
    # error.
    #
    # .NOTES
    # This function also supports the use of positional parameters instead of named
    # parameters. If positional parameters are used intead of named parameters,
    # then two positional parameters are required:
    #
    # The first positional parameter is a reference to a System.Object[] (array)
    # that will be used to store output. The function guarantees that the output
    # will always be an array, even when a single item is returned.
    #
    # The second positional parameter is a reference (pointer) to a
    # System.Reflection.RuntimeAssembly object from which the function will get
    # its exported types.
