function Get-ScriptingFileSystemObjectSafely {
    # .SYNOPSIS
    # Creates a COM object for Scripting.FileSystemObject.
    #
    # .DESCRIPTION
    # Creates a COM object for Scripting.FileSystemObject. If the object cannot be
    # created, then the function will return $false. If the object is created
    # successfully, then the function will return $true.
    #
    # .PARAMETER ReferenceToStoreObject
    # This parameter is required; it is a reference to an object that will become
    # the FileSystemObject COM object. If the object is created successfully, then
    # the referenced object will be updated, storing the FileSystemObject COM
    # object. If the object is not created successfully, then the referenced
    # variable becomes undefined.
    #
    # .EXAMPLE
    # $objScriptingFileSystemObject = $null
    # $boolSuccess = Get-ScriptingFileSystemObjectSafely -ReferenceToStoreObject ([ref]$objScriptingFileSystemObject)
    #
    # .EXAMPLE
    # $objScriptingFileSystemObject = $null
    # $boolSuccess = Get-ScriptingFileSystemObjectSafely ([ref]$objScriptingFileSystemObject)
    #
    # .INPUTS
    # None. You can't pipe objects to Get-ScriptingFileSystemObjectSafely.
    #
    # .OUTPUTS
    # System.Boolean. Get-ScriptingFileSystemObjectSafely returns a boolean value
    # indiciating whether the Scripting.FileSystemObject object was created
    # successfully. $true means the object was created successfully; $false means
    # there was an error.
    #
    # .NOTES
    # This function also supports the use of an argument, which can be used
    # instead of the parameter.
    #
    # The first argument and only argument is a reference to an object that will
    # become the FileSystemObject COM object. If the object is created
    # successfully, then the referenced object will be updated, storing the
    # FileSystemObject COM object. If the object is not created successfully, then
    # the referenced variable becomes undefined.
